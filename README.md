Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever, a practical alternative to Openplanet, but for TMNF and TMUF.

## Special thanks
To [GreffMASTER](https://github.com/GreffMASTER) and [brokenphilip](https://github.com/brokenphilip) for helping me during development. brokenphilip has his own [tool for TMUF](https://github.com/BulbToys/TMUF) and GreffMASTER [as well (for TM1.0)](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/TMStuff) if you're interested in more cool mods for old TM games.\
GreffMASTER also provided me with a helpful list of class members and their offsets for TMF, alongside brokenphilip helping me along my RE journey for this project <3

## Medal.tv
Due to Medal's uncooperativeness, you might have to do these following steps to make Twinkie work alongside it: 
- Make sure your Medal app is up to date first. 
- Then, in Settings > Advanced and in the “Advanced | Recording” section, turn on "Force Window Capture". 
Keep in mind that **this is an experimental setting**, **it might not work at all** or **it might make your clips stuttery** but it is worth trying.

## Features
- Ghost Editor, allows you to access the ghost editor without the cheat code.
- Dashboard, an input display and gear display (tachometer, and gear number indicator) with customizable options
- Checkpoint counter, does what it says right on the tin
- Medals window, for easily viewing medals
- Tweaker, for customizing your render distance (even though [TMUnlimiter already does that](https://github.com/tomek0055/TMUnlimiter/wiki/Game-Settings))
- ~~**Hunting Stats**, a module that keeps track of your progress for each map~~
- **Always official**, that brings up the Official Mode menu when you reset (only for United accounts)
- **Nickname patch**, sets the nickname text box to have a larger size than normal

## Contribute
To know how to make new modules, check out [`CreatingModules.md`](https://github.com/TwinkieTweaks/Twinkie/blob/master/CreatingModules.md)

## Create separate builds for different TMF variants
The visual studio solution already comes with various build options for some TMF variants.\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25da4bde-8146-4740-94d6-d7e75660a87a)\
Building in x64 is **not supported** since TMF is 32-bit.\
If you're having compilation issues, make sure you're **ONLY** compiling to x86/Win32.\
Building for United and Nations is not currently supported. Only Modloader builds are.

## Support me
There currently aren't any monetary ways of supporting me, so if you like Twinkie and you have a github account, please star it so that more people see it, or be kind enough to share it with your friends.
